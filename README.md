# kiauh_OrangePi4
Klipper install and update helper?? for armbian / tested on OrangePi4 and OrangePiZeroLTS

This is a space where I will test Kiauh using Fluidd or Mainsail through the Moonraker api, to run Klipper on Armbian using the OrangePi4 & OrangePiZeroLTS as
an alternative to the RaspberryPI.

Will order a OrangePiZero2 when restocked(silicon shortage?)

So far I havent had to change anything, Kaiuh has handled everything I have asked it to do. Though my Klipper and Fluidd/Mainsail experience is so what new. (still figuring out macros)
